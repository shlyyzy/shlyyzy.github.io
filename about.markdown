Music aficionado, STEM outreach enthusiast, fake coffee fan...
I'm Shirley, and I'm a 3rd year computer science student at UBC. Not the best at putting into words who I am, necessarily, though I'm glad you've stumbled upon this page and would like to get to know a bit more about me! This site is a compilation of all the things that make up who I amâ€“I'll let it do the talking.
