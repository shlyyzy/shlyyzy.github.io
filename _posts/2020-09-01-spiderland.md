# Spiderland - Slint
#### (album review)

##### existential dread
##### key tracks: good morning, captain ; breadcrumb trail (basically every song... it's only 6 tracks anyways) 

if any album describes the feeling that is existential dread, it's spiderland. this has always been an album that I've proclaimed to have listened to, but if I have to be quite honest I've always visited very sparsely and on a very surface-level. that is to say, I didn't necessarily listen to this album out of pure enjoyment. I knew that it was big in the underground circles of its time and went on to be hugely influential to a lot of post-rock and math rock acts. like a lot of music I listen to (at least initially), I wanted to get some insight into the sounds of the genres that I do often listen to, and where/who it's derived from. slint was no exception.

revisiting spiderland, however, has completely changed my perception of the album. it's no longer a relic of the past whose offering is only to provide musical context. in this historical landscape amidst the pandemic, it offers much more. the aesthetics of the album really intrigued me at first. the band members in the river, the black and white, nosferatu man referencing the grainy vampire film that holds a certain surreal quality... it certainly evoked some sort of strange emotion that is difficult to put into words and oddly resembles a phantom nostalgia–yearning for something that was never there. it evokes the same emotions that camus, kafka, and other figures in the existential, absurdist, and surrealist realms evoke.

McMahan's hushed spoken word verses paint a bleak outlook on life with a heavy sense of alienation. drenched in distortion, the guitar riffs purposefully envelop the vocal poetry. it's disconcerting as their repetitive nature creeps up in each song, unassuming in their repetitiveness yet unsettling for a reason you can't pinpoint. the buildups serve their purpose, overwhelming and intense at their height, feeling like the mental chaos that evolves into a sense of calm and acceptance of that existential dread that is a huge part of the record. Walford's drumming brings a much-needed point of focus on each track. while everything else is devolving, it's tethered and stabilized by the drums–the rhythm keeps things in check and prevents complete chaos. however, the drums themselves have a groggy, heavy leaden quality, a slowness that characterizes the calm before a mental breakdown (especially with the lagging and dragging drumming on 'washer'). it's especially unsettling because it's something that the listener feels quite clearly, falling into a disassociative trance that you know is leading up to something. something out of control.

and then the song ends. and a new one begins–with the same structure and style as the previous one. nonetheless, the album is never boring, the repetitiveness isn't a gimmick, and every track is distinct... the record is an amalgamation of all the existential dread and suffering that one can possibly feel–it's a snapshot of a slow deterioration of the mind. the kafkaesque nature of the record, the sense of alienation and desolation lends itself well to the album.
isolation and loneliness is always dehabilitating, but this record depicts the mind of a person who is already halfway gone. for that, it's perfect.
