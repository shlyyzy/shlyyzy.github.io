# the disintegration loops - william basinski
#### (album review)

just witnessed the rise & fall of humanity. thank you

actually going to be expanding on my thoughts.... listening to this in its entirety makes me feel like i'm living all these different experiences, lives–a lifetime's worth. it's all in the abstract, but nevertheless, the complete visceral experience is at my fingertips. the sounds are so breathtaking–the echoes pervade the space that you're in. with each loop, there's less focus on my own thoughts; i'm usually thinking of dozens of things by the time a second has passed, and i used to jokingly think that by the time i hit the halfway point, i'd run out of thoughts to think, that i would have literally thought it all. all that i'm capable of seriously coming up with, everything just a regurgitation of whatever has come before. and slowly, it'll all just disintegrate. with the disintegration loops, everything just fades–the chamber of sound that it provides is a haven. some weird, incredible teleportation device that brings me to everywhere and everything that has been experienced–it's brought out memories that have been long forgotten. the lilts, pauses, the slow destruction of space and sound are not resigned in a way that may be expected. they yearn for what they had once been, but with an acceptance that is seemingly nurtured with time.
