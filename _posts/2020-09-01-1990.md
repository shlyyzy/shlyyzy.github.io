# 1990 - daniel johnston
#### (album review)

##### key tracks: all of them. don't skip a single one. listen to the whole thing all the way through.
original post: 
a record that is deeply personal to me. nothing has ever thrust me into the depths of despair and pulled me back out before like this record has. beautifully haunting, raw, heart-wrenching.
at a time when things sucked, it felt like this album was a direct manifestation of my inner-most feelings.
do i remember how many times i've sobbed with this playing at 3AM? no.

**more thoughts**: 
daniel johnston saved my life. 1990 was that album for me. every single time that i listen to it, tears just flow freely and it's just devastating and gut-wrenching. it's powerful. there's something very child-like yet learned in his writing. his lyrics are like an extension of himself, and as you listen, an extension of you as well. every strained vocal and guttural scream makes you feel heardâ€“daniel's just voicing exactly how you feel, or had once felt.

there's humorous moments too, on this album. when daniel says, "one more time" to the amused and slightly wary audience to sing *funeral home*. they're laughing as he states some truths, matter-of-fact. 

there's something very direct and real about his music, but at the same time it's so strangely inexplicably viscerally raw and sad that you almost feel like it's an extension of your subconscious. it's a part of you, but not quite tangible or truly real and existing. it's the dull ache when you're half awake or a dream that you can't quite remember (listen to *softly and tenderly* and you'll know what i mean)
