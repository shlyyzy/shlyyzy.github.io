# Ceremony - New Order (Substance; 1987)
#### (song review)

##### heaven knows, it's got to be this time...
ceremony is quite possibly one of my favourite songs ever. my experience with it is visceral in nature, i can't explain why i love it but just that it was one of the first songs that really had a deep emotional impact on me. i'll never forget the first time i listened to this trackâ€“i was driving in a huge snowstorm at midnight during the last few days of december. the festive lights were blurred by the snow, everything was white, the road right ahead the only destination, and i decide to listen to the song for the first time. it was absolutely breath-taking.

another sorta shameless plug of my spotify :)
