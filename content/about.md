Outside of work and school, I get overly excited about [STEM outreach and education](https://www.projecttechconferences.com/portfolios#:~:text=View%20past%20events-,OUTREACH,-Small%20scale%2C%20community), overpriced vinyl, climbing mountains 🏔, creating about a million playlists 🎧, my philosophy courses 👥, analyzing hockey stats 🏒, and organizing my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/shlyyzy/) 🎞.

### What am I listening to right now? Glad you asked!
